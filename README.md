# rocket-simulation

Data Modelling and Simulation Project
Overview

This project simulates the flight of a rocket using Python. It models physical parameters like velocity, height, trajectory, and acceleration, and provides real-time visualization using Tkinter, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

The simulation offers a basic graphical interface that allows you to start and stop the simulation with buttons, while also displaying some flight data in the console.
